                <h3>How We Met</h3>
                <p>We met via match.com in October of 2014. On our first date, we realized our paths had crossed before: When we were teenagers, Brandon managed the Quizno's directly across the street from my neighborhood, and I remembered seeing him there on the weekends, reading the newspaper. We grew up very near each other, and, to add to the coincidences, we still did: Brandon lived in a condo just one street over from my apartment.</p>
                <h3>Travels</h3>
                <p>When I met Brandon, he told me his personal goal was to travel internationally at least once per year. He was looking for a partner to share in these adventures with. I was more than willing!</p>
                <h3>Athens Proposal</h3>
                <p>In September 2017,  Brandon proposed on our rooftop garden overlooking Acropolis.</p>

                <p>In March 2015 we had our first adventure together to New York, NY. Following New York was a trip to Antigua for Brandon's father's wedding, then Kansas City, MO for a 90's concert, and capped the year off with a Thanksgiving trip to San Francisco.</p>

                <p>In 2016, We explored Washington, D.C. (still one of our favorite trips), Berlin, Amsterdam, London & Paris. I still think the best part of that year was Billy the greyhound joining the family in March, though.</p>

                <p>2017 has been one of our favorite years as far as adventures go. Travelling to Montana to visit Yellowstone National Park, a weekend getaway to Louisville, KY and a trip to Maui with Brandon's Dad, Step-mom, and Aunt Heather. In September, we took a family trip to Greece where Brandon popped the question.</p>

                <p>We already have big plans for 2018. Arizona to see the Grand Canyon and Antelope Canyons with best friends, Banff National Park in Alberta, and a Thanksgiving trip to Rome with our parents!</p>

<!-- Why a Destination Wedding -->
    <section id="destinationwedding" class="container content-section text-center">
        <div class="row" style="color: black">
            <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
                <h2>Why We Chose a Destination Wedding</h2>
                                   <h3>For the Love of Travel</h3>
<p><i>"Whitefish is a resort town in the Rocky Mountains of northwest Montana. It’s a gateway to the jagged peaks, lakes and glacier-carved valleys of Glacier National Park. Home to bighorn sheep, mountain goats, grizzly bears, golden eagles, Canadian lynx, wolverines, and many other beasts and birds, Glacier National Park is 16,000 square miles of mountains, meadows and lakes on the Continental Divide, a breathtaking landscape so remote it is sometimes lonely even in our crowded age."</i></p>

<p>Ever since Brandon and I traveled to Montana in May 2017, we knew we wanted to see more mountains and wildlife. We visited a lot of different cities in our travels together, but nothing compared to the excitement of experiencing bears, bighorn sheep, coyote, and other wild animals in their natural habitat when visiting Yellowstone National Park. Not to mention the gorgeous backdrop. Glacier National Park was added to our bucket list shortly after that trip.</p>

<p>When planning our wedding, we wanted it to be something that is representative of us and who we are as a couple. We love to travel and experience new places. We couldn't envision getting married in St. Louis when our best times together have been packing up and getting lost in new worlds. We would love to share this intimate experience with our closest family and friends.  We are so very appreciative of anyone who can make the journey to spend our wedding day with us.</p>

<h3>To Have an Intimate Wedding</h3>
<p>We want to be surrounded by those who truly know us. Having a destination wedding allows us to spend more quality time with each of our guests and have a more intimate experience.</p>

<h3>To Have More Than Just a Wedding</h3>
<p>We view this as a time for our family and friends to come together and have an unforgettable experience. Not just a wedding, but a chance to get to know each other and have a great time, for more than just one night. With a destination wedding, we have the ability to plan multiple events surrounding the wedding. We look forward to a fun-filled weekend in the mountains with our friends and families.</p>

<h3>To Have a Good Time</h3>
<p>Photographing multiple weddings together has given us a unique behind-the-scenes perspective of weddings. Between the stress of  coordinating vendors, guests, and bridal parties - it seemed easy to lose sight of the reason for the wedding.</p>

<p>We want our wedding to be enjoyable to our guests and to us. Leaving the planning to the resort allows us to focus on why we're there: to make a lifelong commitment to one another and celebrate this time in our lives.</p>

              <h2>Whitefish Mountain Resort</h2>
              <p>
                <b>Zip Line Tours</b>
                <br>Soar high above ski slopes, over ravines and through the trees on Montana’s longest zip line tour. Experience more than a mile of flying on seven separate lines stretching as long as 1,900 ft. across and up to 300 ft. above the forest floor. Tours are led by two guides who ensure that each flyer is soundly secured for each flight and who facilitate fun from start to finish.                <br><br>
                <b>Aerial Adventure Park</b>
                <br>We call it “the happy place” because we see so many people overjoyed with excitement and a sense of accomplishment here. We also call it “an obstacle course in the trees” because there are five courses of various ability levels, each featuring different elements for getting from tree to tree. Traverse from tree to tree by crossing cable bridges, climbing rope ladders, swinging on a trapeze and more. The park is a great activity for families, friends and team building.                <br><br>
                <b>Summit Nature Center</b>
                <br>A must do for families at the summit is to visit the Summit Nature Center. Operated and staffed by the Flathead National Forest, families love to visit the Summit Nature Center to learn about our forest and its local flora and fauna.                <br><br>
                <b>Mountain Biking</b>
                <br>Ride more than 30 miles of lift-accessed and cross-country mountain bike trails above the Flathead Valley.
                <br>In Whitefish, we go with the flow. Our laid back vibe is one of the reasons why people keep coming back. That and the other relaxing characteristics: our lazy meandering river, pours of locally-brewed beers and community full of easy-going locals. Even our bike trails have flow. It's a term that often describes mountain bike trails. The way they are carved into a mountain in harmony with its contours for a smooth ride so you can, well, go with the flow.
                <br><br>
                <b>Alpine Slide</b>
                <br>Take sliding to a whole new level on the Alpine Slide. Ride a sled one-third mile down dips, around banked turns, under bridges, and through a tunnel while controlling speed with a hand brake. Each lap down the slide includes a free chairlift on Chair 6 back to the top of the slide. The Alpine Slide is fun for all ages, from 1 to 101.                <br><br>
                <b>Scenic Lift Rides</b>
                <br>Ranked #1 among Whitefish attractions on Trip Advisor, Scenic Lift Rides are a must-do in the summer. Choose from an enclosed gondola or an open chairlift, then sit back and enjoy the mountain scenery as well as views of Whitefish Lake, the Flathead Valley and Glacier National Park on the ride to the summit. Once at the summit, enjoy 360-degree views before returning down the mountain, or spend some time at the Summit House in the full cafeteria-style restaurant and bar or in the Summit Nature Center.
                <br><br>
                <b>Hiking</b>
                <br>Whether you are looking for a multi-hour trek or an unhurried wander in the woods, our trails offer a mountain adventure for you and your troop. Hiking trails are located at different elevations on the mountain with trailheads at the summit, in the village and at the Base Lodge.

                <br><br><i>Logan Pass Visitor Center</i>
                <br>
                The Logan Pass Visitor Center sits atop the Continental Divide at 6,646 feet. The visitor center houses exhibits on the plants and animals found in the sub-alpine region of the park.
                <br><br><i>St. Mary Visitor Center</i>
                <br>
                The St. Mary Visitor Center is located just inside the east entrance of the park near the community of St. Mary, Montana. A park film is shown throughout the day. Exhibits highlight the rich Native American history associated with Glacier National Park.
                <br><br>

                <br><br><b>Guided Tours</b>
                <br>Rangers are not the only naturalists that lead groups in the park. Check out the tour options offered by park concessions.
                <br><br><b>Going-to-the-sun Road</b>
                <br>A quintessential part of any Glacier visit, Going-to-the-Sun Road connects the east and west sides through the middle of the park.
                <br><br><b>Camping, Biking, and Fishing</b>
                <br>Enjoy the crackling of a campfire and sleep under the stars. With 13 campgrounds and 1,009 sites to choose from, options are plentiful.
                <br><br>Learn the rules for biker access on Going-to-the-Sun Road and other opportunities available to cyclists.
                <br><br>No license is needed to fish in the park, but you do need to know the many rules and limits, which vary with each body of water.
